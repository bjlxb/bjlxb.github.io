Mac使用homebrew安装配置mysql
<!--more-->
##### 一、安装homebrew
使用如下命令安装homebrew
```basic
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```
homebrew官网：  https://brew.sh/index_zh-cn.html
##### 二、安装mysql
```basic
brew install mysql

==> Downloading https://homebrew.bintray.com/bottles/mysql-8.0.16.mojave.bottle.
==> Downloading from https://akamai.bintray.com/65/65e6629740ca75ceaae575b4cc68f
######################################################################## 100.0%
==> Pouring mysql-8.0.16.mojave.bottle.tar.gz
==> /usr/local/Cellar/mysql/8.0.16/bin/mysqld --initialize-insecure --user=liuxi
==> Caveats
We've installed your MySQL database without a root password. To secure it run:
    mysql_secure_installation

MySQL is configured to only allow connections from localhost by default

To connect run:
    mysql -uroot

To have launchd start mysql now and restart at login:
  brew services start mysql
Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
  mysql.server start
==> Summary
🍺  /usr/local/Cellar/mysql/8.0.16: 275 files, 269.8MB
==> `brew cleanup` has not been run in 30 days, running now...

```
##### 三、配置自启动
```basic
mkdir -p ~/Library/LaunchAgents

ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/mysql/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents

find /usr/local/Cellar/mysql/ -name "homebrew.mxcl.mysql.plist" -exec cp {} ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ \;

launchctl load -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.mysql.plist
```
##### 四、启动mysql服务
```basic
mysql.server start

Starting MySQL
. SUCCESS!
```
##### 五、初始化mysql配置
```c
mysql_secure_installation

Securing the MySQL server deployment.

Connecting to MySQL using a blank password.

VALIDATE PASSWORD COMPONENT can be used to test passwords
and improve security. It checks the strength of password
and allows the users to set only those passwords which are
secure enough. Would you like to setup VALIDATE PASSWORD component?

Press y|Y for Yes, any other key for No: n // 这个选yes的话密码长度就必须要设置为8位以上，但我只想要6位的
Please set the password for root here.

New password: // 设置密码

Re-enter new password: // 再一次确认密码
By default, a MySQL installation has an anonymous user,
allowing anyone to log into MySQL without having to have
a user account created for them. This is intended only for
testing, and to make the installation go a bit smoother.
You should remove them before moving into a production
environment.

Remove anonymous users? (Press y|Y for Yes, any other key for No) : y // 移除不用密码的那个账户
Success.


Normally, root should only be allowed to connect from
'localhost'. This ensures that someone cannot guess at
the root password from the network.

Disallow root login remotely? (Press y|Y for Yes, any other key for No) : n //不接受root远程登录账号

 ... skipping.
By default, MySQL comes with a database named 'test' that
anyone can access. This is also intended only for testing,
and should be removed before moving into a production
environment.


Remove test database and access to it? (Press y|Y for Yes, any other key for No) : y  //删除text数据库
 - Dropping test database...
Success.

 - Removing privileges on test database...
Success.参考链接

Reloading the privilege tables will ensure that all changes
made so far will take effect immediately.

Reload privilege tables now? (Press y|Y for Yes, any other key for No) : y
Success.

All done!
```
